# 📦 0x03 - Unittests and Integration Tests

This project is part of the **ALX Backend Python** track. It covers **unit testing**, **integration testing**, and related techniques using Python’s built-in `unittest` framework, `mock`, `parameterized`, and custom decorators like `memoize`.

- Patch objects, methods, and properties during tests.
- Apply memoization and test its behavior.
- Build integration tests using fixtures.
- Follow Python documentation and type-annotation best practices.
